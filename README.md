Adding Noise to Images
This project demonstrates the process of adding noise to images using Salt & Pepper Noise and Gaussian Noise techniques. The implementation is done in Scilab.

Features
Salt & Pepper Noise: Simulates pixel-level noise that randomly turns some pixels completely white (salt) or black (pepper).
Gaussian Noise: Simulates continuous noise based on the Gaussian distribution.
How to Use
Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
Open the file image_noise.sce in Scilab.

Run the script to observe the effects of different types of noise on images.

Requirements
Scilab: Ensure you have Scilab installed on your system to execute the script.
Project Structure
image_noise.sce - The Scilab script for adding noise to images.

Applications
This script is useful for testing image processing algorithms by simulating noisy data.
